IMPORTANT: Context compaction is imminent. You MUST save the active workstream '${ACTIVE_NAME}' state NOW.

Write an updated state file to: ${STATE_FILE}

Use atomic overwrite:
1. Write content to ${STATE_FILE}.new
2. command mv ${STATE_FILE} ${STATE_FILE}.bak (if exists)
3. command mv ${STATE_FILE}.new ${STATE_FILE}

The state file must be under 80 lines and include:
- Current status (what was being worked on)
- Key decisions made
- Next steps
- Any blockers or important context that would be lost

Then update the registry and reset the context monitor:
bash "\${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/update-registry.sh" "${ACTIVE_NAME}"
bash "\${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/reset-counter.sh"
EOF

exit 0
